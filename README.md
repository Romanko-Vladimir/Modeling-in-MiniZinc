# Modeling in MiniZinc - constraint programming.
My codes of models in MiniZinc (rare constraint programming language). All codes are short because MiniZinc is a high-level constraint programming system, which uses third-party solvers. Every folder has an own README-file with a detailed explanation.

I studied discrete optimization in MiniZinc via a MOOC-course at Coursera "Basic Modeling for Discrete Optimization"
